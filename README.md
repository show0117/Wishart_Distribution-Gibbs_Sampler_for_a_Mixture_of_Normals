# A comparison study of Wishart Distribution & Gibbs Sampler for a Mixture of Normals

This study will extend the Gibbs Sampling simulation mixed multivariate normal distribution mentioned in class, and introduce the Wishart distribution and the Full conditional of multivariate normality. Simulate using the faithful data set as observations, use Gibbs Sampling and EM algorithms to find the most suitable parent parameters, and check whether they converge.
